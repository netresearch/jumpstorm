JUMPSTORM
=========

*Jumpstorm* wants to help you concentrate on the task you have to do. No more time has to be wasted for Magento setup. It
even could setup your Magento automatically, so it can even be used for demo or test systems.

Its flexible architecture allows you to extend its functionality as you need.

For extension with modman support, deployment is done with modman_, so you'll get a ready-to-use installation at the end.
All the other extensions, e.g. from Magento Connect will be hard-copied to your Magento.

.. _modman: https://github.com/colinmollenhour/modman

Installation
============

Clone from Github:

::

  git clone --recursive https://github.com/netresearch/jumpstorm.git

  cd jumpstorm

**Hint:**

    We recommend to symlink the executable ``jumpstorm`` in ``/usr/bin`` or at least to create an alias in your
    ``~/.profile``:

    ::

      echo 'alias jumpstorm="/path/to/jumpstorm/executable"' >> ~/.profile
      source ~/.profile

    After that you can leave the folder ``jumpstorm`` and use command ``jumpstorm`` instead of ``./jumpstorm`` in the
    following tutorial.

Usage
=====

Type on command line:

::

  ./jumpstorm

and you will get a list of available commands and options.

Currently supported commands are

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - command
     - description

   * - ``magento``
     - Install Magento_

   * - ``extensions``
     - Install extensions_

   * - ``unittesting``
     - Install framework for unittests_ and prepare test database

   * - ``plugins``
     - Run plugins_

   * - ``run``
     - Combines the other commands: install Magento, prepare unittesting, install extensions and run plugins

.. _unittests: Unittesting_

The first thing you should do, is creating the configuration file, your installation should be based on.
We provided a sample configuration file ``ini/sample.jumpstorm.ini``, *Jumpstorm* will use ``ini/jumpstorm.ini`` by
default, but you could specify a different configuration file by using option ``-c``  (``--config``):

::

  ./jumpstorm magento -c /path/to/my/ini

Every command needs the ``[common]`` section of the configuration file, so you should fill in the correct values of the
Magento target path and your database settings.

Magento
-------

As you propably expected, this command will install Magento.

Let's have a look at the ``[magento]`` section of your configuration file:

*Jumpstorm* needs to know where to find Magento, you will have to specify that in option ``source``. [#source]_
If you decide for Git as source, you might specify a ``branch``.

.. [#source] *Jumpstorm* is well-tested to support Git, but other sources like file system and ssh are supported, too.

During installation Magento will need to know its base url and it will create an admin account.
You should set its data in your configuration file.

If you want *Jumpstorm* to install Magento sample data, you should provide its source [#source]_ (and its branch, if
source is Git).

When you finished configuration, you will get a fresh Magento installation after running

::

  ./jumpstorm magento -c /path/to/my/ini

Please note, that option ``-c /path/to/my/ini`` is optional.

Extensions
----------

*Jumpstorm* was developed for testing, supporting, and developing extensions. So let's have a look into extension
installation configuration.

In section ``[extensions]`` you can provide a list of extensions to be installed automatically. For every extension you
have to provide a source [#source]_ and you could provide a branch, if you use Git as source.

You could also decide to use Magento Connect as extension source. In that case, please use the following syntax in your
configuration file, e.g. Fooman Speedster:

::

  fooman_speedster  = magentoconnect://community/Fooman_Speedster

All configured extension will be installed by executing:

::

  ./jumpstorm extensions -c /path/to/my/ini

Please note, that option ``-c /path/to/my/ini`` is optional.

Unittesting
-----------

We are big fans of test driven development. So unit testing is essential.
In our sample configuration file, EcomDev_PHPUnit is used as default testing framework. We recommend to use this, so just
copy this section to your configuration file (you could set its branch to ``dev``, if you want to use its latest
features and bugfixes).

Now just run the following command and start testing and developing:

::

  ./jumpstorm unittesting -c /path/to/my/ini

Please note, that option ``-c /path/to/my/ini`` is optional.

Plugins
-------

In some cases you may want to have a little different setup, e.g. some special
users, products, or settings. To achieve that, *Jumpstorm* is extendible.
The sample configuration file already provides a ``[plugins]`` section. Every
plugin mentioned there will be executed by running

::

  ./jumpstorm plugins -c /path/to/my/ini

Please note, that option ``-c /path/to/my/ini`` is optional.

How to write your own plugins?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Plugins follow a simple structure. They are placed in the ``plugins`` directory.
Each plugin is itself a directory with at least one php file inside, containing
a php class:

::

  jumpstorm
  ├── ini
  │   └── custom
  │       ├── main.ini
  │       └── plugin_d.ini
  …
  └── plugins
      ├── PluginA
      │   └── PluginA.php
      └── PluginD
          └── PluginD.php

The directory, the php file and the php class must have the same name
(with uppercase first letter) as is used in the main configuration file. Plugins
can be easily disabled by either not mentioning them in the main configuration
or by setting their configuration value ``enabled`` to ``0``:

::

  ; Plugin will be skipped
  PluginA.enabled = 0
   
  ; Plugin will be active and will have that single configuration value "someValue"
  PluginB = someValue 
  
  ; Plugin will be active and will have configuration ['foo' => 0, 'bar' => 'foobar']
  PluginC.foo = 0
  PluginC.bar = foobar

  ; Plugin will be active and will load additional settings from given path
  PluginD.ini = ini/custom/plugin_d.ini

The plugin's main php class must implement Netresearch\\PluginInterface.

Interactive mode
----------------

If you use *Jumpstorm* for a bunch of different projects on and on, you become tired of changing the config file. So it
would be nice to specify some settings to be confirmed (and corrected) during execution of *Jumpstorm*. This mode will
be suppressed by the built-in option ``-n`` (``--no-interaction``).
